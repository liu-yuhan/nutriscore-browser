# Pine APP Project (or: nutriscore-browser)

This is the repository for my final project at Coding Academy.

It's a team project at Coding Academy, simulating an agile environment with a product owner, a scrum master, and a team of developers.

We were a team of 6 developers, during the span of three weeks.

Trello boards used for the project management can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/R8365SpY/coding-academy-les-petits-merneu) and [here](https://trello.com/b/BqWxaZ4S/uncover).

The project consists in developing a responsive web app, aimed at mobile and desktop users, that enable browsing basic nutri-score informations, fetched from OpenFoodFacts API.

The information can be searched from scanning barcodes, or with an index search.

It embeds a user space (with login/register features, a configurable profile, and a browsing history).

The front-end is developed with React, Redux, and Bootstrap. It is fully responsive.

The back-end is developed with Node.JS and MongoDB.
